## Handling Difficult Situations

### When You Disagree with a Reviewer

Never dismiss a reviewer's concern outright. The formula:

```
1. Acknowledge the reviewer's point
   "We appreciate this thoughtful observation."

2. Present your reasoning with evidence
   "Our approach is supported by [Author, Year] who demonstrated..."

3. Show you have considered the alternative
   "We have added a paragraph discussing this alternative interpretation
    (Section 4.3, lines 312-325)."

4. Offer a compromise when possible
   "As a compromise, we have added a sensitivity analysis using the
    reviewer's suggested approach, which yields consistent results
    (Supplementary Table S3)."
```

### When a Requested Analysis is Infeasible

```
Structure:
1. Explain why it cannot be done
   "Unfortunately, [specific reason] prevents us from performing this
    analysis. [Data was not collected / sample size is insufficient /
    IRB protocol does not cover this]."

2. Offer the closest feasible alternative
   "As an alternative, we have conducted [alternative analysis],
    which addresses the same underlying concern."

3. Acknowledge the limitation
   "We have added this as a limitation in Section 5.2."
```

## Cover Letter for Revision

                           major_changes: list[str],
                           editor_name: str = "Editor") -> str:
    """Generate a revision cover letter template."""
    changes_list = '\n'.join(f'  {i+1}. {c}' for i, c in enumerate(major_changes))

    return f"""Dear {editor_name},

## Revision Tracking Best Practices

- Use track changes or highlight all modified text in the revised manuscript
- Provide both a marked-up version and a clean version
- Reference specific line numbers, figure numbers, or section numbers
- If the revision substantially changes a figure or table, include the old and new versions side by side in the response document
- Submit the revision within the editor's requested timeline (typically 30-90 days)
