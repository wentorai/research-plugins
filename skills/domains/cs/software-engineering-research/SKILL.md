# Software Engineering Research Guide

Navigate the landscape of software engineering research, including key subfields, methodologies, datasets, benchmarks, and top venues.

## SE Research Subfields

| Subfield | Key Topics | Major Venues |
|----------|-----------|-------------|
| **Software Testing** | Test generation, fuzzing, mutation testing, flaky tests | ISSTA, ICST, ASE |
| **Program Analysis** | Static analysis, abstract interpretation, symbolic execution | PLDI, POPL, OOPSLA |
| **Software Maintenance** | Code refactoring, technical debt, code smells, evolution | ICSME, MSR, SANER |
| **SE for AI/ML** | ML pipeline testing, data quality, model debugging | ICSE-SEIP, FSE |
| **AI for SE** | Code generation, bug detection, program repair | ICSE, FSE, ASE |
| **Distributed Systems** | Consensus, fault tolerance, scalability, microservices | SOSP, OSDI, EuroSys |
| **Cybersecurity** | Vulnerability detection, malware analysis, privacy | IEEE S&P, CCS, USENIX Security |
| **HCI in SE** | Developer tools, IDE usability, code comprehension | CHI, CSCW, VL/HCC |
| **Empirical SE** | Mining repositories, developer surveys, controlled experiments | ESEM, MSR, TOSEM |

## Research Methodologies in SE

### Controlled Experiments

Testing a specific hypothesis with treatment and control groups:

```markdown
Example: Does AI code completion improve developer productivity?

Design:
- Participants: 60 professional developers
- Treatment: IDE with AI code completion enabled
- Control: IDE with AI code completion disabled
- Task: Complete 5 programming tasks of varying difficulty
- Metrics: Task completion time, code correctness, lines of code
- Analysis: Mixed-effects linear model with participant as random effect

Threats to validity:
- Internal: Learning effect (counterbalance task order)
- External: Lab setting may not reflect real development
- Construct: "Productivity" operationalized as speed + correctness
```

### Mining Software Repositories (MSR)

Analyzing data from version control, issue trackers, code review systems:

```python
# Example: Analyze commit patterns using PyDriller
from pydriller import Repository

repo_url = "https://github.com/apache/kafka"

commit_data = []
for commit in Repository(repo_url, since=datetime(2023, 1, 1),
                          to=datetime(2023, 12, 31)).traverse_commits():
    commit_data.append({
        "hash": commit.hash[:8],
        "author": commit.author.name,
        "date": commit.committer_date,
        "files_changed": commit.files,
        "insertions": commit.insertions,
        "deletions": commit.deletions,
        "message": commit.msg[:100]
    })

df = pd.DataFrame(commit_data)
print(f"Total commits in 2023: {len(df)}")
print(f"Unique contributors: {df['author'].nunique()}")
print(f"Avg files per commit: {df['files_changed'].mean():.1f}")
```

### Case Studies

In-depth investigation of a phenomenon in its real-world context:

```markdown
Case Study Protocol (based on Yin, 2018):
1. Research questions: How do teams adopt microservices?
2. Unit of analysis: Development teams at 3 companies
3. Data sources:
   - Semi-structured interviews (8-12 per company)
   - Architecture documentation review
   - Commit history and deployment logs
   - Meeting observations
4. Analysis: Thematic analysis with cross-case comparison
5. Validity: Triangulation across data sources, member checking
```

## Key Datasets and Benchmarks

### Code Understanding and Generation

| Benchmark | Task | Languages | Size |
|-----------|------|-----------|------|
| HumanEval | Code generation from docstrings | Python | 164 problems |
| MBPP | Code generation from descriptions | Python | 974 problems |
| SWE-bench | Real-world GitHub issue resolution | Python | 2,294 instances |
| CodeXGLUE | Multiple code tasks | 6 languages | Varies by task |
| BigCloneBench | Clone detection | Java | 6M clone pairs |
| Defects4J | Bug localization and repair | Java | 835 real bugs |

### Software Engineering Process

| Dataset | Content | Use Cases |
|---------|---------|-----------|
| GHTorrent | GitHub event data (commits, issues, PRs) | MSR studies |
| Software Heritage | Universal source code archive | Code evolution, provenance |
| Stack Overflow Data Dump | Q&A posts, tags, votes | Developer knowledge, NLP |
| CVE Database | Vulnerability records | Security research |
| Chrome/Firefox Bug Trackers | Bug reports, patches | Bug triage, severity prediction |

## Static Analysis Tools for Research

```python
# Example: Using tree-sitter for AST-level code analysis
from tree_sitter import Language, Parser
import tree_sitter_python as tspython

PYTHON_LANGUAGE = Language(tspython.language())
parser = Parser(PYTHON_LANGUAGE)

source_code = b"""
def fibonacci(n):
    if n <= 1:
        return n
    return fibonacci(n-1) + fibonacci(n-2)
"""

tree = parser.parse(source_code)
root = tree.root_node

def count_nodes(node, node_type):
    """Count AST nodes of a given type."""
    count = 1 if node.type == node_type else 0
    for child in node.children:
        count += count_nodes(child, node_type)
    return count

print(f"Function definitions: {count_nodes(root, 'function_definition')}")
print(f"If statements: {count_nodes(root, 'if_statement')}")
print(f"Return statements: {count_nodes(root, 'return_statement')}")
print(f"Function calls: {count_nodes(root, 'call')}")
```

## Code Metrics

```python
# Common software metrics
metrics = {
    "Lines of Code (LOC)": "Total lines (including blanks and comments)",
    "Cyclomatic Complexity": "Number of independent paths (McCabe, 1976)",
    "Halstead Volume": "Based on operators and operands count",
    "Maintainability Index": "Composite of LOC, CC, and Halstead",
    "Coupling Between Objects": "Number of other classes referenced",
    "Depth of Inheritance": "Levels in class hierarchy",
    "Code Churn": "Lines added + modified + deleted per period",
    "Comment Density": "Ratio of comment lines to total lines"
}

# Calculate cyclomatic complexity using radon
# pip install radon
import subprocess
result = subprocess.run(
    ["radon", "cc", "my_module.py", "-s", "-j"],
    capture_output=True, text=True
)
print(result.stdout)
```
