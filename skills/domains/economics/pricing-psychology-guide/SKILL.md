# Pricing Psychology Guide

## Overview

Pricing psychology sits at the intersection of behavioral economics, marketing science, and consumer research. Classical economics assumes consumers evaluate prices rationally -- comparing marginal utility to marginal cost. Decades of experimental evidence show this is wrong. Consumers use heuristics, are influenced by reference points, respond to framing, and systematically deviate from rational price evaluation.

Understanding these deviations is both scientifically important (they reveal how human cognition processes economic information) and practically consequential (pricing is one of the highest-leverage decisions firms make). This guide covers the key psychological mechanisms in pricing, experimental methods for studying them, and the analytical tools researchers use to measure willingness to pay and price sensitivity.

The focus is on academic rigor: well-identified causal effects, incentive-compatible elicitation methods, and results that replicate. The field has been significantly impacted by the replication crisis, and this guide emphasizes methodological best practices that meet current standards.

## Core Psychological Mechanisms

### Anchoring and Price Perception

```
Anchoring in pricing (Tversky & Kahneman, 1974):

MECHANISM:
- Initial price exposure creates a reference point
- Subsequent judgments are adjusted (insufficiently) from that anchor
- Effect persists even when the anchor is clearly irrelevant

EXPERIMENTAL EVIDENCE:
1. Ariely et al. (2003): Social security number → WTP for wine
   - Students with higher SS numbers bid more for identical wine
   - Effect size: r = 0.33-0.52 across product categories

2. Northcraft & Neale (1987): Real estate anchoring
   - Listing price influenced expert appraisers
   - Experts denied being influenced (unaware of the effect)

3. Nunes & Boatwright (2004): Incidental anchors in retail
   - Adjacent product prices influence focal product evaluation
   - Even when products are in different categories

RESEARCH DESIGN:
- Random anchor assignment is critical for causal identification
- Include manipulation check: "Were you influenced by the initial number?"
- Pre-register the anchor-WTP relationship hypothesis
```

### Reference Price Theory

```
Reference price = the price consumers expect or consider "normal"

TYPES OF REFERENCE PRICES:
1. Internal reference price (memory-based)
   - Last price paid
   - Expected future price
   - "Fair" or "just" price

2. External reference price (context-based)
   - Competitor prices displayed
   - MSRP / "was" price (strikethrough pricing)
   - Unit price comparisons

PROSPECT THEORY APPLICATION (Kahneman & Tversky, 1979):
- Price < Reference → GAIN → Purchase more likely
- Price > Reference → LOSS → Loss aversion kicks in
- Loss aversion coefficient lambda ≈ 2.0-2.5 for prices
- Implication: Price increases hurt more than equivalent decreases help
```

### Key Pricing Effects

| Effect | Description | Evidence Strength |
|--------|-------------|------------------|
| Left-digit effect | $3.99 perceived much cheaper than $4.00 | Strong (Thomas & Morwitz, 2005) |
| Decoy effect | Asymmetrically dominated option shifts choice | Strong (Huber et al., 1982) |
| Compromise effect | Middle option preferred in three-option sets | Strong (Simonson, 1989) |
| Endowment effect | WTA > WTP (owners value goods more) | Moderate (post-replication) |
| Mental accounting | Money categorized into separate mental accounts | Strong (Thaler, 1999) |
| Price-quality heuristic | Higher price = higher quality perception | Moderate (context-dependent) |
| Pain of paying | Neural pain response to spending money | Strong (Prelec & Loewenstein, 1998) |
| Bundle bias | Preference for bundled pricing over itemized | Moderate |

## Experimental Methods

### Willingness-to-Pay Elicitation

```python
import numpy as np
from typing import List, Dict

def bdm_mechanism(stated_wtp: float, price_range: tuple = (0, 50)) -> dict:
    """
    Becker-DeGroot-Marschak (BDM) incentive-compatible mechanism.
    Participants state WTP; random price drawn; buy if WTP >= price.
    Truthful reporting is the dominant strategy.
    """
    random_price = np.random.uniform(*price_range)
    purchase = stated_wtp >= random_price
    return {
        "stated_wtp": stated_wtp,
        "random_price": round(random_price, 2),
        "purchased": purchase,

            {"price": p, "buy": None, "keep_money": None}
            for p in sorted(prices)
        ],
        "wtp_estimate": "Midpoint between last 'buy' and first 'keep money'",
    }

def van_westendorp_psm(
    too_cheap: List[float],
    cheap: List[float],
    expensive: List[float],
    too_expensive: List[float],
) -> dict:

### Conjoint Analysis for Price Research

```python
# Discrete Choice Experiment (DCE) for price research
# Standard method for decomposing preferences across attributes including price

design_example = {
    "attributes": {
        "brand": ["Brand A", "Brand B", "Brand C"],
        "features": ["Basic", "Standard", "Premium"],
        "price": ["$9.99", "$14.99", "$19.99", "$24.99"],
        "warranty": ["1 year", "3 years"],
    },
    "design": "D-optimal fractional factorial",
    "choice_sets": 12,       # Number of choice tasks per respondent
    "alternatives": 3,       # Options per choice set (+ no-purchase)
    "sample_size": 300,      # Respondents

    "analysis": "Mixed logit (random coefficients) for heterogeneity",
    "output": {
        "part_worths": "Utility contribution of each attribute level",

        "optimal_price": "Price that maximizes share or revenue",
    },
}
```

## Price Elasticity Estimation

```python
import numpy as np
from scipy import stats

def estimate_price_elasticity(
    prices: np.ndarray,
    quantities: np.ndarray,
    method: str = "log-log",
) -> dict:
    """
    Estimate price elasticity of demand.

    Methods:
    - "log-log": ln(Q) = a + e*ln(P) + error (constant elasticity)
    - "arc": Midpoint elasticity between two points
    """
    if method == "log-log":
        log_p = np.log(prices)
        log_q = np.log(quantities)
        slope, intercept, r_value, p_value, std_err = stats.linregress(log_p, log_q)
        return {
            "elasticity": slope,

                "elastic" if abs(slope) > 1
                else "unit elastic" if abs(slope) == 1
                else "inelastic"
            ),
        }
    elif method == "arc":
        # Midpoint method for discrete price changes
        elasticities = []
        for i in range(len(prices) - 1):
            pct_q = (quantities[i+1] - quantities[i]) / ((quantities[i+1] + quantities[i]) / 2)
            pct_p = (prices[i+1] - prices[i]) / ((prices[i+1] + prices[i]) / 2)
            if pct_p != 0:
                elasticities.append(pct_q / pct_p)
        return {
            "arc_elasticities": elasticities,
            "mean_elasticity": np.mean(elasticities),
        }
```

## Experimental Design Checklist

```
Pricing experiment design checklist:

1. INCENTIVE COMPATIBILITY
   [ ] Use BDM, Vickrey auction, or real purchase
   [ ] Never use hypothetical WTP without validation
   [ ] Endow participants with money to make purchases real

2. REFERENCE PRICE CONTROL
   [ ] Measure or manipulate reference prices
   [ ] Control for prior brand/product experience
   [ ] Randomize presentation order

3. DEMAND CHARACTERISTICS
   [ ] Blind participants to the pricing manipulation
   [ ] Include filler products to mask the focal comparison
   [ ] Use between-subjects design for price comparisons

4. ECOLOGICAL VALIDITY
   [ ] Use realistic product descriptions and images
   [ ] Set price ranges within the market range
   [ ] Include a "no purchase" option

5. ANALYSIS
   [ ] Pre-register hypotheses and analysis plan
   [ ] Report effect sizes and confidence intervals
   [ ] Test for heterogeneity across consumer segments
   [ ] Check for order effects and carryover
```

## Best Practices

- **Use incentive-compatible methods.** Hypothetical WTP overstates actual WTP by 2-3x on average.
- **Control for reference prices.** Uncontrolled reference prices are the biggest confound in pricing experiments.
- **Report effect sizes, not just p-values.** A statistically significant 2-cent WTP difference is not managerially meaningful.
- **Test external validity.** Lab results do not automatically generalize to market settings.
- **Account for heterogeneity.** Price sensitivity varies enormously across consumer segments.
- **Pre-register.** Pricing studies have many researcher degrees of freedom (outlier exclusion, model specification, subsample selection).
