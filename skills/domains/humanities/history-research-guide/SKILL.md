# History Research Guide

## Overview

Historical research transforms raw evidence from the past -- documents, artifacts, images, oral testimonies -- into interpretive accounts that explain how and why things happened. The discipline demands a distinctive set of skills: source criticism, archival navigation, contextual reasoning, and the ability to construct arguments that are both evidence-based and theoretically informed.

The digital turn has expanded the historian's toolkit dramatically. Digitized archives, text mining, GIS mapping, and network analysis now complement traditional close reading. But the fundamentals remain unchanged: rigorous engagement with primary sources, awareness of historiographical debates, and transparent argumentation.

This guide covers the full research workflow for historians: finding and evaluating primary sources, navigating archives (physical and digital), applying source criticism, structuring historical arguments, and leveraging digital tools for analysis. It serves researchers at all levels, from graduate students designing their first archival project to established scholars integrating computational methods.

## Source Criticism: The Foundation

### External Criticism (Authenticity)

```
Questions to establish source authenticity:

1. PROVENANCE
   - Where did this document come from?
   - What is the chain of custody?
   - Has it been reproduced, translated, or edited?

2. DATING
   - When was it created? (Internal evidence: dates, references to events)
   - Does the material form match the claimed period? (paper, ink, typeface)
   - Are there anachronisms in language or content?

3. AUTHORSHIP
   - Who created it? How do we know?
   - Is the attribution reliable? (Handwriting analysis, stylistic evidence)
   - Could it be pseudonymous or falsely attributed?

4. INTEGRITY
   - Is the document complete or fragmentary?
   - Has it been altered, censored, or interpolated?
   - Are there multiple versions? Which is closest to the original?
```

### Internal Criticism (Reliability and Meaning)

```
Questions to interpret source content:

1. CONTEXT
   - What was happening when this was written?
   - What was the author's social position, education, ideology?
   - What genre conventions shaped the document?

2. INTENTION
   - Why was this created? (Inform, persuade, record, entertain)
   - Who was the intended audience?
   - What was the author trying to achieve?

3. RELIABILITY
   - Was the author in a position to know what they describe?
   - What biases might shape the account?
   - How does it compare with other sources on the same events?

4. SILENCES
   - What is NOT said? Who is absent from the account?
   - What topics does the source avoid or minimize?
   - What perspectives are excluded?
```

## Archival Research

### Preparing for the Archive

```
Pre-visit checklist:

1. FINDING AIDS
   - Search online catalogs and finding aids before visiting
   - Identify relevant record groups, series, and box numbers
   - Contact the archivist: they know the collection better than anyone

2. PRACTICAL PREPARATION
   - Check policies: photography allowed? Laptop permitted?
   - Bring: pencils (no pens), laptop, camera, white gloves, notebook
   - Register in advance (many archives require pre-registration)
   - Book a desk (popular archives fill up, especially in summer)

3. RESEARCH PLAN
   - Prioritize: You cannot read everything. What is essential?
   - Prepare a list of specific documents, people, dates to search for
   - Allow time for serendipity -- unexpected finds are common

4. DOCUMENTATION
   - Record full archival citations for every document:
     [Archive Name], [Collection Name], [Series], [Box], [Folder], [Item]
   - Photograph everything you might need (storage is cheap)
   - Take contextual notes alongside transcriptions
```

## Historiographical Frameworks

### Schools of Historical Thought

| School | Key Ideas | Key Figures |
|--------|-----------|-------------|
| Rankean positivism | "wie es eigentlich gewesen" (as it actually was) | Ranke |
| Annales School | Longue duree, mentalites, total history | Bloch, Braudel, Le Roy Ladurie |
| Marxist historiography | Class struggle, mode of production | Thompson, Hobsbawm, Hill |
| Social history | History from below, ordinary people | Thompson, Zinn |
| Cultural history | Representations, meaning, symbols | Darnton, Chartier, Burke |
| Postcolonial history | Subaltern voices, decolonizing the archive | Said, Spivak, Chakrabarty |
| Gender history | Gender as analytical category | Scott, Butler |
| Microhistory | Intensive study of small units | Ginzburg, Davis |
| Digital history | Computational methods, big data | Moretti, Underwood |
| Global history | Connected, entangled, transnational | Bayly, Conrad |

### Braudel's Three Temporalities

```
Time layers in historical analysis:

1. LONGUE DUREE (centuries)
   - Geography, climate, demographics
   - Slow structural change
   - Example: Mediterranean trade routes, 500 BCE - 1500 CE

2. CONJUNCTURES (decades)
   - Economic cycles, social trends, institutional change
   - Medium-term patterns
   - Example: Rise and fall of Atlantic slave trade, 1500-1888

3. EVENTS (days to years)
   - Political events, battles, treaties, revolutions
   - Surface history, "l'histoire evenementielle"
   - Example: Fall of the Berlin Wall, November 9, 1989

Research tip: Strong historical arguments often operate across
multiple temporalities simultaneously.

## Digital Methods for Historians

### Text Mining Historical Sources

```python
# Example: Word frequency analysis across a corpus of historical documents
from collections import Counter
import re

def analyze_historical_corpus(texts: list, period_labels: list) -> dict:
    """
    Track keyword frequency across historical periods.
    Useful for tracing conceptual change (Begriffsgeschichte).
    """
    period_counts = {}
    for text, period in zip(texts, period_labels):
        words = re.findall(r'\b[a-z]+\b', text.lower())
        if period not in period_counts:
            period_counts[period] = Counter()
        period_counts[period].update(words)

    return period_counts

# Track usage of key concepts over time
def track_concept(period_counts: dict, concept_terms: list) -> dict:
    """Track normalized frequency of concept terms across periods."""
    results = {}
    for period, counts in sorted(period_counts.items()):
        total = sum(counts.values())
        concept_freq = sum(counts.get(term, 0) for term in concept_terms)
        results[period] = {
            "raw_count": concept_freq,
            "per_million": (concept_freq / total) * 1_000_000 if total > 0 else 0,
        }
    return results

# Example: Track "liberty" vs. "order" in political texts
# liberty_trend = track_concept(corpus, ["liberty", "freedom", "rights"])
# order_trend = track_concept(corpus, ["order", "authority", "stability"])
```

### GIS for Historical Analysis

```
Applications of GIS in historical research:

- Mapping migration patterns (transatlantic slave trade routes)
- Spatial analysis of urban development (Paris renovation, 1853-1870)
- Battle reconstruction (troop movements, terrain analysis)
- Disease mapping (John Snow's cholera map, modernized)
- Trade network visualization (Silk Road, maritime routes)
- Land use change over time (enclosure, deforestation)

Tools: QGIS (free), ArcGIS, Google Earth Engine
Data: HGIS (Historical GIS), Natural Earth, GADM
```

## Writing Historical Research

```
Article structure (American Historical Review style):

1. OPENING (1-2 pages)
   - Narrative opening or striking primary source quotation
   - Situate within historiographical debate
   - Thesis statement (explicit and arguable)

2. BODY (15-25 pages)
   - Organized chronologically OR thematically
   - Each section advances the argument
   - Primary source evidence drives every claim
   - Engage with counterarguments and alternative interpretations
   - Footnotes: full citations, also substantive discussion

3. CONCLUSION (1-2 pages)
   - Restate thesis in light of evidence presented
   - Broader implications for the field
   - Open questions for future research

Citation style: Chicago Manual of Style (notes-bibliography)

## Best Practices

- **Always return to the primary source.** Secondary sources summarize; primary sources surprise.
- **Triangulate.** Use multiple independent sources to corroborate claims.
- **Historicize your categories.** "Democracy," "race," "the state" meant different things in different periods.
- **Acknowledge what the sources cannot tell you.** Silence is data.
- **Read against the grain.** Sources reveal not just what they intend but what they take for granted.
- **Cite archival sources precisely.** Other researchers must be able to find the same document.
