## Preprocessing Pipeline

### Standard Preprocessing Steps

```python
import numpy as np

def preprocess_medical_image(image, modality="xray"):
    """
    Standard preprocessing pipeline for medical images.

    Steps vary by modality but typically include:
    1. Intensity normalization
    2. Resizing/resampling
    3. Windowing (for CT)
    4. Artifact removal
    """
    if modality == "ct":
        # CT windowing: map Hounsfield Units to display range
        # Lung window: center=-600, width=1500
        # Soft tissue: center=40, width=400
        window_center = -600
        window_width = 1500
        lower = window_center - window_width // 2
        upper = window_center + window_width // 2
        image = np.clip(image, lower, upper)
        image = (image - lower) / (upper - lower)

    elif modality == "xray":
        # Normalize to [0, 1] range
        image = image.astype(np.float32)
        image = (image - image.min()) / (image.max() - image.min() + 1e-8)

    elif modality == "mri":
        # Z-score normalization (per-volume)
        # Exclude background (zeros) from statistics
        mask = image > 0
        if mask.any():
            mean_val = image[mask].mean()
            std_val = image[mask].std()
            image = (image - mean_val) / (std_val + 1e-8)

    return image


def resize_with_spacing(image, original_spacing, target_spacing):
    """
    Resample 3D medical image to uniform voxel spacing.
    Essential for CT/MRI where slice thickness varies.

    Args:
        image: 3D numpy array
        original_spacing: (z, y, x) voxel sizes in mm
        target_spacing: desired (z, y, x) voxel sizes in mm
    """
    from scipy.ndimage import zoom

    resize_factor = [
        orig / target
        for orig, target in zip(original_spacing, target_spacing)
    ]
    resampled = zoom(image, resize_factor, order=1)
    return resampled
```

## Model Architecture Selection

### Task-Specific Architectures

```
Architecture recommendations by task:

IMAGE CLASSIFICATION (diagnosis, grading):
  - ResNet-50/101: reliable baseline, well-understood
  - EfficientNet-B4/B5: better accuracy-efficiency tradeoff
  - Vision Transformer (ViT): strong with large datasets
  - DenseNet-121: popular for chest X-ray (CheXNet heritage)

  Transfer learning approach:
    1. Start with ImageNet pretrained weights
    2. Replace final classifier layer
    3. Fine-tune with low learning rate (1e-4 to 1e-5)
    4. Use gradual unfreezing (train head, then all layers)

IMAGE SEGMENTATION (organ/lesion delineation):
  - U-Net: gold standard for medical segmentation
  - nnU-Net: self-configuring U-Net (state-of-the-art framework)
  - Attention U-Net: U-Net with attention gates
  - TransUNet: hybrid CNN-Transformer architecture
  - MONAI: framework with pre-built medical imaging models

  For 3D volumes:
    - 3D U-Net: full volumetric processing
    - V-Net: 3D with dice loss
    - 2.5D approach: adjacent slices as multi-channel input

OBJECT DETECTION (lesion localization):
  - YOLO variants: fast inference, suitable for screening
  - Faster R-CNN: higher accuracy, slower
  - RetinaNet: handles class imbalance (focal loss)
  - DETR: transformer-based, no anchor boxes needed
```

## Handling Small Datasets

### Data Augmentation for Medical Images

```python
def get_medical_augmentation_pipeline():
    """
    Medical image augmentation strategy.

    Key differences from natural image augmentation:
    - Preserve anatomical plausibility
    - Avoid color jitter (intensity has diagnostic meaning)
    - Use elastic deformations (mimic anatomical variability)
    - Apply carefully (aggressive augmentation can hurt)
    """
    import albumentations as A

    transform = A.Compose([
        # Spatial transforms (safe for medical images)
        A.HorizontalFlip(p=0.5),
        A.RandomRotate90(p=0.5),
        A.ShiftScaleRotate(
            shift_limit=0.1, scale_limit=0.1,
            rotate_limit=15, p=0.5
        ),
        A.ElasticTransform(
            alpha=120, sigma=120 * 0.05,
            p=0.3
        ),

        # Intensity transforms (use cautiously)
        A.RandomBrightnessContrast(
            brightness_limit=0.1,
            contrast_limit=0.1, p=0.3
        ),
        A.GaussNoise(var_limit=(10, 50), p=0.2),
        A.GaussianBlur(blur_limit=(3, 5), p=0.2),
    ])

    return transform
```

### Transfer Learning Strategies

```
Transfer learning approaches for small medical datasets:

Strategy 1 - ImageNet pretraining (most common):
  - Works surprisingly well despite domain gap
  - Low-level features (edges, textures) transfer well
  - Fine-tune all layers with small learning rate
  - Typical improvement: 5-15% over training from scratch

Strategy 2 - Medical domain pretraining:
  - Pretrain on large medical dataset, fine-tune on target
  - RadImageNet: 1.35M radiological images
  - Models Genesis: self-supervised pretraining on CT/X-ray
  - Better than ImageNet for most medical tasks

Strategy 3 - Self-supervised pretraining:
  - Contrastive learning (SimCLR, MoCo, DINO)
  - Masked image modeling (MAE)
  - No labels needed for pretraining phase
  - Effective when labeled data is very scarce (< 100 images)

Strategy 4 - Few-shot learning:
  - Prototypical networks, MAML
  - Useful for rare diseases with < 20 examples
  - Active research area, not yet production-ready
```

## Evaluation Metrics

### Medical Imaging Specific Metrics

```
Classification metrics:
  - AUROC (Area Under ROC Curve): discrimination ability
    - Primary metric for most medical imaging papers
    - Report with 95% confidence interval (bootstrap)
  - AUPRC (Area Under Precision-Recall Curve):
    - Better than AUROC for imbalanced datasets
    - Common in lesion detection tasks
  - Sensitivity at fixed specificity:
    - e.g., "Sensitivity of 92% at 95% specificity"
    - Clinically meaningful operating point
  - Specificity at fixed sensitivity:
    - e.g., "Specificity of 88% at 90% sensitivity"
    - Ensures acceptable miss rate

Segmentation metrics:
  - Dice Similarity Coefficient (DSC):
    - DSC = 2|A intersection B| / (|A| + |B|)
    - Range: 0 (no overlap) to 1 (perfect overlap)
    - Most commonly reported segmentation metric
  - Hausdorff Distance (HD95):
    - Maximum surface distance between predictions and ground truth
    - Use 95th percentile (HD95) to reduce sensitivity to outliers
    - Reports boundary accuracy in millimeters
  - Average Surface Distance (ASD):
    - Mean distance between predicted and true surfaces

Reporting standards:
  - Always report confidence intervals (95% CI)
  - Use 5-fold cross-validation or held-out test set
  - Report per-class metrics for multi-class problems
  - Compare against at least one established baseline
  - Report results on external validation set when possible
```

## Ethical and Regulatory Considerations

```
Responsible AI in medical imaging research:

Data ethics:
  - De-identify all DICOM headers (remove patient name, ID, dates)
  - Use approved de-identification tools (e.g., DICOM Cleaner)
  - Obtain IRB/ethics approval before starting
  - Data use agreements for public datasets

Bias and fairness:
  - Report demographic breakdown of training data
  - Test performance across subgroups (age, sex, ethnicity)
  - Acknowledge known demographic biases in training data
  - CheXpert and MIMIC-CXR include demographic metadata for this

Reproducibility:
  - Share code and trained model weights when possible
  - Report all hyperparameters and random seeds
  - Use standardized evaluation protocols
  - Follow CLAIM (Checklist for AI in Medical Imaging) guidelines

Clinical translation (if applicable):
  - FDA/CE marking required for clinical use (not research)
  - Software as Medical Device (SaMD) classification
  - Prospective clinical validation required
  - Research prototypes are NOT approved for clinical decisions
```

Medical imaging AI is advancing rapidly, but responsible research requires careful attention to data quality, evaluation rigor, and clinical relevance. The gap between a model that performs well on a benchmark and one that adds genuine clinical value remains significant, and bridging it requires interdisciplinary collaboration between computer scientists, radiologists, pathologists, and clinical researchers.
