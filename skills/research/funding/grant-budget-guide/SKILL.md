# Grant Budget Guide

A skill for preparing realistic, well-justified research grant budgets. Covers common budget categories across major funding agencies (NSF, NIH, ERC, EPSRC, NSERC), cost estimation methods, budget justification writing, common mistakes that trigger reviewer concerns, and strategies for handling budget cuts during negotiation.

## Budget Categories

### Standard Budget Structure

Most funding agencies use similar budget categories, though terminology and rules vary. Understanding the universal structure helps when applying to any funder.

```
Standard Grant Budget Categories:

1. PERSONNEL (typically 50-70% of total)
   a. Principal Investigator (PI) salary + benefits
   b. Co-PI salary + benefits
   c. Postdoctoral researchers
   d. Graduate research assistants (stipend + tuition)
   e. Undergraduate assistants
   f. Research technicians / lab managers
   g. Administrative support (if justified)

2. EQUIPMENT (items > agency threshold, e.g., > $5,000)
   a. Major equipment purchases
   b. Fabrication costs
   c. Computer hardware (if specialized)
   Note: Standard office computers usually NOT allowed

3. TRAVEL
   a. Domestic conference travel
   b. International conference travel
   c. Fieldwork travel
   d. Collaboration visits
   e. Per diem and accommodation

4. MATERIALS AND SUPPLIES
   a. Lab consumables (reagents, chemicals, glassware)
   b. Software licenses
   c. Computing costs (cloud, HPC allocations)
   d. Participant incentives / compensation
   e. Printing, copying, publication charges

5. OTHER DIRECT COSTS
   a. Subcontracts / subawards
   b. Consultant fees
   c. Human subjects costs (IRB fees, participant payments)
   d. Publication fees (open access charges)
   e. Specialized services (sequencing, imaging, surveys)

6. INDIRECT COSTS (F&A - Facilities and Administration)
   a. Calculated as percentage of modified total direct costs
   b. Rate negotiated between institution and government
   c. Typical US university rate: 50-65% (on-campus)
   d. Some agencies cap indirect costs
```

## Cost Estimation

### Personnel Cost Calculation

```
Estimating personnel costs:

PI salary:
  Monthly salary = Annual salary / 12
  Person-months requested = Calendar months of effort
  Cost = Monthly salary x Person-months
  Benefits = Cost x Fringe benefit rate

  Example:
    Annual salary: $120,000
    Effort: 2 summer months (of 12 calendar months)
    Salary cost: $120,000 / 12 x 2 = $20,000
    Fringe benefits at 30%: $6,000
    Total PI cost: $26,000 per year

Postdoc salary:
  Check institution's postdoc salary scale
  NIH NRSA stipend levels provide a common benchmark
  Include annual raises (3-4% per year)
  Include full benefits (health insurance, retirement)

  Example (3-year project):
    Year 1: $56,000 + 30% fringe = $72,800
    Year 2: $57,680 + 30% fringe = $74,984
    Year 3: $59,410 + 30% fringe = $77,233
    Total: $225,017

Graduate student:
  Stipend (12 months): varies by institution ($25,000-$40,000)
  Tuition remission: often charged to the grant ($15,000-$50,000)
  Health insurance: $2,000-$5,000/year
  Total per student per year: $42,000-$95,000
```

### Inflation and Multi-Year Projections

```python
def project_costs(base_cost, years, inflation_rate=0.03):
    """
    Project costs over multiple years with inflation.

    Most agencies expect 3% annual inflation for personnel
    and 2-5% for supplies depending on the field.
    """
    yearly_costs = []
    for year in range(years):
        adjusted = base_cost * (1 + inflation_rate) ** year
        yearly_costs.append(round(adjusted, 2))
    return yearly_costs

# Example: $50,000 postdoc base over 4 years
# project_costs(50000, 4, 0.03)
# Returns: [50000.00, 51500.00, 53045.00, 54636.35]
```

## Budget Justification Writing

### Structure and Tone

The budget justification is a narrative document that explains WHY each cost is necessary. It should demonstrate that every dollar serves the scientific goals.

```
Budget Justification Template:

A. Personnel

Principal Investigator (Dr. Jane Smith): 2 calendar months of
effort per year ($20,000 salary + $6,000 fringe = $26,000/year).
Dr. Smith will oversee all aspects of the project, including
experimental design, data analysis, and manuscript preparation.
Her expertise in computational neuroscience (see Biographical
Sketch) is essential for the proposed machine learning analyses.

Postdoctoral Researcher (TBD): 12 calendar months of effort per
year ($56,000 salary + $16,800 fringe = $72,800 Year 1, with 3%
annual increases). The postdoc will conduct the primary
computational analyses, develop the novel algorithms described in
Aim 2, and train graduate students on the methodology.

B. Equipment

GPU Computing Server ($35,000): A dedicated server with 4 NVIDIA
A100 GPUs is required for training the deep learning models
described in Aim 2. Cloud computing was considered but would cost
approximately $45,000 over the project period based on estimated
compute hours, making a dedicated server more cost-effective.

C. Travel

Conference travel ($3,000/year): Funds for the PI or postdoc to
attend one domestic conference (estimated: $1,800 for
registration, airfare, hotel, and per diem) and one workshop
($1,200). Target venues include NeurIPS and the Computational
Neuroscience annual meeting, where we will present project
results and recruit collaborators.

D. Materials and Supplies

Cloud computing ($5,000/year): AWS credits for preliminary
analyses and data storage. Estimated 500 GPU-hours at $3/hour
plus 10 TB storage at $0.023/GB/month.

Software licenses ($2,000/year): MATLAB license ($500),
specialized neuroimaging analysis package ($1,500).
```

```

## Common Budget Mistakes

### Red Flags That Concern Reviewers

```
Mistakes to avoid:

1. Padding the budget:
   Problem: Inflated costs "just in case"
   Fix: Estimate realistically, use published cost data

2. Insufficient personnel:
   Problem: Ambitious aims but only 1 person for 5 years
   Fix: Match staffing to the work plan realistically

3. Missing cost categories:
   Problem: No travel budget but claims dissemination plan
   Fix: Budget must align with proposed activities

4. Unjustified equipment:
   Problem: Expensive equipment without explanation of need
   Fix: Explain why existing institutional resources are inadequate

5. No inflation adjustment:
   Problem: Same salary Year 1 through Year 5
   Fix: Include 3% annual increases for personnel

6. Excessive foreign travel:
   Problem: 4 international trips per year for one PI
   Fix: 1-2 conferences per year is typical and defensible

7. Large consultant fees without justification:
   Problem: $50,000 for unnamed consultant
   Fix: Name the consultant, explain unique expertise,
        provide hourly rate and estimated hours

8. Forgetting open access fees:
   Problem: Many funders now mandate open access publication
   Fix: Budget $2,000-$5,000 per paper for APC charges
```

## Handling Budget Cuts

### Negotiation Strategies

```
When your budget is reduced by the agency:

Strategy 1 - Reduce scope proportionally:
  "With a 20% reduction, we will focus on Aims 1 and 2,
   deferring Aim 3 to a subsequent proposal."

Strategy 2 - Reduce personnel:
  "We will hire 1 postdoc instead of 2, extending the
   timeline for Aim 2 by 6 months."

Strategy 3 - Find alternative resources:
  "The PI's department has agreed to provide 1 month of
   summer salary, reducing the budget request by $15,000."

Strategy 4 - Adjust equipment plans:
  "We will use institutional HPC resources instead of
   purchasing dedicated hardware, saving $35,000 but
   adding $8,000 in computing time charges."

What NOT to do:
  - Do not agree to do the same work with less money
  - Do not cut travel to zero (undermines dissemination)
  - Do not eliminate graduate student support (reviewers notice)
  - Do not remove the budget justification details
```

A well-prepared budget demonstrates that the research team has thoughtfully planned the project, understands what resources are truly needed, and will be responsible stewards of public funds. Budget quality correlates with proposal quality in the minds of reviewers, and a sloppy budget can undermine an otherwise strong scientific narrative.
