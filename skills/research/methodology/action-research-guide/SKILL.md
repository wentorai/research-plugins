# Action Research Guide

A skill for designing and conducting action research (AR), participatory action research (PAR), and community-based participatory research (CBPR). Covers the cyclical AR process, stakeholder engagement, data collection within action cycles, and balancing rigor with practical impact.

## What Is Action Research?

### Defining Characteristics

```
Action research is research conducted WITH and FOR participants,
not ON them. It aims to produce both practical improvements and
new knowledge simultaneously.

Key principles:
  1. Collaboration: Researchers and participants work as partners
  2. Cyclical process: Plan -> Act -> Observe -> Reflect -> Repeat
  3. Practical focus: Solving a real problem in a real setting
  4. Democratic: Participants have voice in research design
  5. Reflexive: Ongoing critical reflection on the process

Contrast with traditional research:
  Traditional: Researcher studies participants at arm's length
  Action research: Researcher and participants co-investigate
```

### Types of Action Research

| Type | Focus | Who Leads |
|------|-------|----------|
| Practical AR | Improving professional practice | Practitioner-researcher |
| Participatory AR (PAR) | Empowerment and social change | Community members + researcher |
| CBPR | Health equity and community needs | Community-academic partnership |
| Educational AR | Improving teaching and learning | Teachers |
| Organizational AR | Improving organizational processes | Internal change agents |

## The Action Research Cycle

### Plan-Act-Observe-Reflect

```python
def action_research_cycle(cycle_number: int,
                          problem: str,
                          planned_action: str) -> dict:
    """
    Structure one cycle of action research.

    Args:
        cycle_number: Which iteration of the cycle (1, 2, 3...)
        problem: The problem or question being addressed
        planned_action: The intervention or change being implemented
    """

        )
    }

    return cycle
```

## Stakeholder Engagement

### Building Genuine Partnerships

```
Spectrum of Participation (from low to high):

  Inform:       One-way communication to participants
  Consult:      Gather input, researcher makes decisions
  Involve:      Participants contribute to some decisions
  Collaborate:  Shared decision-making throughout
  Empower:      Participants lead, researcher supports

True action research operates at the Collaborate or Empower level.

Strategies for genuine engagement:
  - Hold meetings at times and locations convenient for participants
  - Use accessible language (avoid academic jargon)
  - Share data and findings openly with all partners
  - Negotiate authorship and credit transparently
  - Build relationships before starting the research
  - Compensate participants for their time and expertise
```

## Data Collection in Action Research

### Mixed Methods Within Cycles

```
Qualitative data:
  - Reflective journals (researcher and participants)
  - Focus groups after each action cycle
  - Semi-structured interviews with key stakeholders
  - Photographs and video documentation
  - Meeting minutes and decision logs

Quantitative data:
  - Pre/post surveys measuring target outcomes
  - Performance metrics (test scores, health indicators)
  - Process metrics (attendance, participation rates)
  - Time series data across multiple cycles

Integration:
  - Use quantitative data to measure change
  - Use qualitative data to understand WHY change did or did not occur
  - Triangulate across sources for credibility
```

## Ensuring Rigor

### Quality Criteria for Action Research

| Criterion | Strategy |
|-----------|---------|
| Outcome validity | Did the action solve the problem? |
| Process validity | Were methods adequate and appropriate? |
| Democratic validity | Were all stakeholders' perspectives included? |
| Catalytic validity | Did the research energize participants to act? |
| Dialogic validity | Has the work been peer-reviewed or scrutinized? |

### Common Critiques and Responses

```
Critique: "It is not generalizable."
Response: Action research produces transferable insights, not
          statistical generalizations. Thick description allows
          readers to judge applicability to their own context.

Critique: "The researcher is biased (they are part of the setting)."
Response: AR is transparent about the researcher's positionality.
          Reflexive journaling, peer debriefing, and member checking
          mitigate bias. Insider knowledge is a strength, not a flaw.

Critique: "It is just practice improvement, not real research."
Response: AR produces systematic, evidence-based knowledge that is
          publicly shared and peer-reviewed. The dual focus on action
          and research is by design, not a limitation.
```

## Reporting Action Research

Follow the ARCS (Action Research Cycle Reporting Standards) or use the general structure: describe the context and problem, explain the partnership and roles, present each cycle (plan-act-observe-reflect) chronologically, show how the intervention evolved across cycles, report both practical outcomes and theoretical contributions, and reflect on limitations and what you would do differently.
